        "detail": "My research focuses on developing music intelligence for understanding, retrieval, generation, and post-production tasks. This work is structured around three interconnected research directions. First, I investigate {multi-modal representation learning} methods that establish semantic correspondences between music and complementary modalities including natural language, visual content, and other media formats. These representations serve as foundational components for transfer learning in music-related applications. Second, I explore {multi-modal large language models} (MLLMs) for music applications, with a focus on three key subtopics: reasoning, chain-of-thought processes, and tool calling, leveraging the intermediate generation capabilities of language models. Third, I design and evaluate {conversational interfaces} through real-world applications, focusing on user experience, usability, and satisfaction in diverse music-related scenarios, ensuring that the developed technologies meet practical needs and deliver measurable value to end users.",
